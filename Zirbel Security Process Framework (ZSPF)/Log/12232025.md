I am committed to building the Zirbel Security Process Framework. This framework will outline Zirbel diagram format, function, and the interconnections between it and a company's SSP. This framework will ensure not only that a company is documenting their workflows but providing evidence of how they are completing it with hard references to their System Security Plan and evidence.
