**Purpose**
The Zirbel Security Process Framework (ZSPF) establishes a structured method for documenting and governing security workflows within an organization. This framework defines how Zirbel diagrams are used to represent operational activities while mapping directly to security controls, system architecture, and audit evidence. The intent of ZSPF is to improve clarity, consistency, and traceability in security execution across an organization while maintaining employee engagement.

**Problem Statement**
System Security Plans (SSPs) document how security controls are implemented; however, they are primarily written for auditors and assessors rather than the practitioners performing the execution. While many organizations maintain Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to support the SSP narrative, those documents are often text-heavy, inconsistent, and rarely used as day-to-day operational guidance. As a result, there is limited practitioner engagement and a persistent gap between documented controls and real operational behavior.

**Core Concept**
The Zirbel Security Process Framework (ZSPF) introduces an employee-oriented operational layer that connects the daily workflow of an employee to the SSP. Each team maintains a set of Zirbel Diagram-based operational charters which define how the team performs key workflows, which roles are responsible, which systems are involved, which controls are supported, and where the evidence is stored.

These charters align bottom-up from individual contributors through management layers to executive governance. When a new team is created, its first task is to define its operational charter using established workflows as a baseline. Teams can model themselves after proven, mature implementations thus promoting standardization and repeatability using security-focused evidence at scale.

**Objectives**
ZSPF is designed to:
- Make security processes easily accessible to the end-user
- Improve consistency and repeatability in how security process are performed
- Strengthen audit defensibility through explicit workflow-to-control mapping
- Provide a structured manner of analyzing workflows for inefficiencies
- Support onboarding, training, and knowledge transfer for day-to-day functions

**Scope**
The initial scope of ZSPF focuses on security engineering and operations workflows that directly support NIST SP 800-53 control implementation. These include areas such as account management, incident handling, configuration management, and change control. ZSPF is methodology-agnostic and is intended to complement, not replace, existing policies, plans, and procedural documentation.

**Intended Outcomes**
Organizations adopting ZSPF should gain:
- Greater awareness of security control requirements
- Clear alignment between architecture, security, and execution
- Enhanced insight into work execution across teams
- Stronger visibility into process weaknesses or failures
- Improved documentation quality and consistency
