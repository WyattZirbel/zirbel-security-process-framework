# Zirbel Security Process Framework™ (ZSPF)

The **Zirbel Security Process Framework™ (ZSPF)** is a structured method for defining, documenting, and governing security-relevant operational workflows.

ZSPF introduces a standardized system of **Team Charters** and **Zirbel Diagrams™** that map day-to-day activities directly to security controls, compliance obligations, and audit evidence - creating a human-usable operational layer between policy documentation and execution.

ZSPF is designed to improve clarity, repeatability, and traceability across security programs while supporting onboarding, knowledge transfer, control execution, and audit readiness.

## Purpose

Modern security documentation often describes *what* must be done, but rarely *how work is actually performed*. ZSPF enables organizations to express the "working reality" of security operations through structured, role-driven workflow models that align with governance requirements.

This framework may be adopted by security, IT, compliance, governance, and operational teams across regulated and non-regulated environments.
